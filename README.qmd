This is a final project for course 1. This will not be graded, and is intended to provide you with the opportunity to test the skills you've acquired throughout the course in a less structured environment. Reflection questions and rubric items can be found at the end of the project to help self-assessment.

## Instructions

This final project consists of an exploratory data analysis and write up of results you discover. The data set you will be working with is a pre-packaged R data set called `taxi`. Your write up, in index.qmd, will explore (at least) two questions.

## Description

A taxi is a type of vehicle for hire with a driver. Often seen as a yellow vehicle, taxi drivers charge passengers money to transport them from one place to another. These data contain information on a subset of taxi trips in the city of Chicago in 2022. You may have some initial hypotheses on how the taxi system works! For example, it may be reasonable to think the longer the taxi ride is, the more likely a passenger is to tip. If someone is considering working for a taxi company, they may wonder if one company tends to get more tips than the others.

A data table is below:

| variable | description |
|----|----|
| `tip` | Whether the rider left a tip. A factor with levels "yes" and "no" |
| `distance` | The trip distance, in odometer miles |
| `company` | The taxi company, as a factor. Companies that occurred few times were binned as "other" |
| `Time` | time of requested loan |
| `local` | Whether the trip's starting and ending locations are in the same community. See the source data for community area values |
| `dow` | The day of the week in which the trip began, as a factor |
| `month` | The month in which the trip began, as a factor |
| `hour` | The hour of the day in which the trip began, as a numeric |

## Research Questions

You are tasked to use these data to explore the following questions:

1)  Is there there a relationship between the distance (in miles) someone travels in a taxi and if they tip or not?

2)  Do taxi passengers tend to tip more for the company Chicago Independents than the other companies?

Hint: you may need to make a new variable in order to answer the second research question. You may also find the function [`if_else()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/if_else.html) useful.

We challenge you to **Render**; **Commit**; and **Push** after each visualization or summary statistics you create. If you are working on a project with more than one contribute, make sure that you **Pull** before making any progress to ensure your project matches up with the project repository.

## Displaying code

Depending on the purpose of the project, it may be advantageous to either show or hide all of your code in your rendered document. To hide all of your code, set `echo: false` in your YAML. If you want to display your code, set `echo: true`.

## Citations

When working on your project, you may want to include outside sources. When doing so, we need to make sure these sources are properly cited. In order to do so, we need to create a .bib file and specify it in your index.qmd's YAML heading. Your project files include a references.bib txt file. This is where you will put bibtex entries. An example of an entry to be referenced can be seen below:

```         
@article{Cetinkaya2020,
    title        = {A Fresh Look at Introductory Data Science},
    author       = {Cetinkaya, Mine and Ellison, Victoria},
    year         = 2020,
    month        = {08},
    journal      = {Journal of Statistics Education},
    volume       = 29,
    pages        = {1--27},
    doi          = {10.1080/10691898.2020.1804497}
}
```

In this entry above, `Cetinkaya2020` is the citation identifier. The default way to cite an entry in your text is with this syntax: [@citation-identifier].

To automatically generate a references section with your entries, the path to the .bib file needs to be specified in your YAML with bibliography: references.bib. This has been done for you.

## Self rubric

Below are a collection of rubric items to self assess your report.

<details>

<summary>Rubric items</summary>

-   Report should include 1-2 visualizations with accompanying summary statistics per research question.

-   All visualizations should be appropriately labeled, including having a title and customized axes.

-   Only plots and summary statistics that are relevant to the research question(s) should be created.

-   Should come to the conclusion that there is a relationship between longer taxi rides and those who tip (\~ 2 miles difference between tip and no tip).

-   Should come to the conclusion that there is some to little evidence of a relationship between those who tip for Chicago Independents (94.8% of the time) and the rest of the companies (91.8%).

</details>

## Challenge

Using these data, come up with a third research question, add it to your written report, and investigate!
